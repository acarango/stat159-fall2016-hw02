#Stat 159 Homework 2

This report reproduces the analysis from Section 3.1 of Chapter 3. Linear Regression, from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James et al.

In code/ we have the scripts used to generate all graphs and analysis. In images/ we have all scatterplots and histograms generated by the rscripts in both png and pdf format. In data/ we have the original data `Advertising.csv` as well as `regression.RData` (which contains regression and regression summary objects) and `eda-output.txt` (which contains summary statistics for the data) which are outputs of the rscripts. In report/ we have the final report in Rmd md and html formats.

Use `make clean` to remove the md and html versions of the report, and use `make report.html` to regenerate them (the md file is created as an intermediary). Use `make all` or just `make` to generate `regression.RData` and `eda-output.txt` in addition to the report, or use their filenames as arguments for `make` to create them individually.
